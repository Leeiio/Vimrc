VimTip 0: downloading Vim tips

     If you are reading this in a help window, then you have probably already
installed the "Tip of the Day" script, totd.vim .  Congratulations!  You can
now replace this skeleton file with a real vimtips.txt file downloaded from
>
	http://www.vim.org/tips/tip_download.php
<
     If you have not yet installed the totd.vim plugin, check that it is in
the plugin/ directory.  (This file should be in plugin/vimtips/ .)  Then
either wait until the next time you start up vim, or source the plugin and get
a tip:
>
	:runtime plugin/totd.vim
	:TipOfTheDay

(The usual abbreviation rules apply:  you can probably just use :Tip .)  This
file should then show up in a help window.
